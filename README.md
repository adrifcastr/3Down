### Welcome to 3Down

If you went over here, you probably are a N3DS user using Arm9LoaderHax + Luma3DS/Corbenik/anything else that supports the 11.4 NFIRM of the 3DS.

You are probably here because the 11.4 System Update patched a Module that requires NTR itself to be updated by Cell9 to re-allow N3DS Screen Streaming and you want to go back to 11.3 without using SysDowngrader and the CIA Package.
Or you simply don't like 11.4

### Overview of steps

In this section, we will be flashing your deviceâ€™s CTRNAND partition to 11.3

### What you need

- A Torrent Client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)
