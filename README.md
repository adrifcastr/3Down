### Welcome to 3Down

If you went over here, you probably are a N3DS user using Arm9LoaderHax + Luma3DS/Corbenik/anything else that supports the 11.4 NFIRM of the 3DS.

You are probably here because the 11.4 System Update patched something that requires NTR itself to be updated by Cell9 to re-allow N3DS Screen Streaming and you want to go back to 11.3 without using SysDowngrader and the CIA Package.

### Overview of steps

In this section, we will be flashing your device’s CTRNAND partition to 11.3
