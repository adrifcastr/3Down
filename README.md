### Welcome to 3Down

If you went over here, you probably are a N3DS user using Arm9LoaderHax + Luma3DS/Corbenik/anything else that supports the 11.4 NFIRM of the 3DS.

You are probably here because the 11.4 System Update patched something that requires NTR itself to be updated by Cell9 to re-allow N3DS Screen Streaming and you want to go back to 11.3 without using SysDowngrader and the CIA Package.
(Unfortuately I just have an EUR N3DS so if you 3DS is from another region it will probably change it's region through the transfer, so it is not that much recommended to do this. Always **Make a NAND Backup** before you do anything else.)

### Overview of steps

In this section, we will be flashing your deviceâ€™s CTRNAND partition to 11.3

### What you need

- The latest release of [Decrypt9WIP](https://github.com/d0k3/Decrypt9WIP/releases/latest)
- A Torrent Client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)
- The [ctrtransfer11.3-N3DS]()
